## Conan package for [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project)

This is a package for just the core libraries, not the compiler nor any of the **clang**-based tools.

Currently under testing...

### Known issues

The compilation doesn't use the **zlib** library provided by **Conan** instead of the bundled one yet.
