## Conan package for [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project)

This is a package for just the core libraries, not the compiler nor any of the **clang**-based tools.

ðŸš§ Currently under testing... ðŸš§

### Known issues

- The compilation does not use **conan-center**'s **zlib** but the bundled one instead.

- Only version *9.0.1* is supported at the moment.
